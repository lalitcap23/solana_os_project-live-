- Last Activity: Typically last release or last commit; ‚ÄúDocs current‚Äù for documentation sources.

## How will i keep README ‚ÄúLive‚Äù

Option A ‚Äî Manual refresh
- Periodically check each repo and update stars, contributors, and last activity.

Option B ‚Äî Automated updates( implemented ) 
- Add a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow that:
  - Reads a JSON/YAML list of repos.
  - Queries the GitHub API for stars, contributors, last commit/release.
  - Rebuilds this table and commits changes daily/weekly.





## Contributions

- PRs welcome for additions, category tweaks, and fixes.
- Preference for:
  - Active repos with recent commits/releases.
  - NEW projects
  - Widely used infrastructure, SDKs, standards, and tooling.
  - Clear OSS licensing and good documentation.
 
Stars ‚≠ê appreciated ‚Äî helps others discover this repo.  
More projects & automation (GitHub Actions for live updates) coming soon.
